Scripts used to infer the population structure, genetic diversity, and paleoecological niche modelling of Phytelephas aequatorialis. Original scripts were written by A. J. Helmstetter (https://github.com/ajhelmstetter/afrodyn/) and S. Jarvie, and modified by S. Escobar.
Data to run these scripts can be found in https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.98sf7m0gz
